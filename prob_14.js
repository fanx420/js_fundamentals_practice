/*ðŸ§  Problem: Clean & Capitalize Product Names
You are given a list of raw product names that include inconsistent casing and extra filler words like "the", "a", "new", etc. You need to:

Remove the filler words unless they are the first word.

Capitalize the first letter of each remaining word.

Join the words back into a clean product name.

ðŸ§¾ Input:
const products = [
  "the new iphone",
  "a portable charger",
  "wireless bluetooth speaker",
  "the smart home hub",
  "new android tablet"
];

const fillerWords = ["the", "a", "an", "new"];
âœ… Expected Output:
[
  "The Iphone",
  "A Portable Charger",
  "Wireless Bluetooth Speaker",
  "The Smart Home Hub",
  "New Android Tablet"
] */
